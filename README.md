# ASTEROID GAME

I developed this application as JAVA PROGRAMMING capstone project. This is my first Java Trying :) 

## The Game

In this game; user controls the spaceship that gradually moves straight, user can shift spaceship to left or rigth. 
While spaceship is moving, the user will encounter asteroids and user need to blow up asteroids. 

At the start spaceship is loaded with 50 bullets and increases 3 bullets per second. 

User can press:  
1. A or Left Arrow to sift left,  
2. D or Right Arrow to sift right,
3. 1 to fire single bullet, 
4. 2 to fire double bullets,

If user crashes to an asteroid it will loose 20% of healt and will heal 2% per second, if the ship loose 100% of healt 
the game ends.

## Technology

I used JAVAFX for this application.
